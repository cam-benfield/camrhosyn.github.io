Data science is everywhere. It's in the food we eat, the games we play when we're well, and the doctors we see when we're sick. Mental health and medicine, and their associated bodies of knowledge have largely been fueled by statistics and research in recent years. In mental health specifically, behaviors and thought patterns previously have been thought to be random for the majority of human history. It is only with the advent of the scientific method and, unfortunately, the abuse of thousands of patients, that we have arrived at the current methodologies and understanding of various mood and personality disorders. Thankfully, the fields of data science and psychiatry have merged to create a much safer, more effective treatment plan for patients. 

That's where I come in. As a patient in the mental health system, I've seen the good and bad. It's been a long and bumpy road, and I can speak from experience that more modern, innovative doctors generally have happier, more satisfied patients with better results from medications and treatment plans. 

Overall, data science is where innovation happens, even if it is not the most exciting type of innovation. Research, and its associated data, should be accessible to the average person. It should be a part of everyday life that non-data scientists can understand even on a basic level, as misinformation, for a lot of patients, can be the difference between life and death. My experiences with mental health showed me what a difference providing patients with access to research can make. 

My ultimate goal is to work in the medical industry, optimizing data for usage within healthcare organizations to better leverage patient data. Be it in the mental health care continuum, in telemetry units, or in healthcare informatics, progress and an understanding of even incredibly simple patterns in incredibly large amounts of data can literally save lives and that's what I want to do.
